# 👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Tzu-Lun Chen, a CST (Computer Systems Technology) student at Saskatchewan Polytechnic with a strong background in system integration, technical documentation, and project coordination. Prior to this, I led large-scale defense integration efforts and collaborated with international vendors on complex system solutions. I’m now transitioning into the IT industry with a focus on software development, system analysis, and stakeholder-driven solutions.
